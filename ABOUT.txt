This is a part of the evolutionary computing. The program has:
1. Random Genotype Generator
2. Mutation
3. Cut and Crossover
4. Fitness Measurement

The Random Genotype generator generates different positions(genotype) where the
Queen's will be placed.
The Mutation helps to create the different genotypes for the variety of the Queen's 
position.
Cut and Crossover helps to create a new genotype using two parent genotypes.
Fitness Measurement will decide which configuration of the Queens's is the best
placed where no Queen's threaten the other queen.
